# CSC200H-PawlikiBox

In order to run you will need to download the word2vec file from

https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/blob/master/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin.gz

Save this file in the pawliki folder. With the command "cargo run" given from inside the pawliki folder, all other dependencies should be automatically imported appropriately thanks to the cargo.lock and cargo.toml files, and Pawliza will come alive before your eyes.
